									<h2><a href="#">Pizza Ordering System for ZazzyZa </a></h2>
									<p> This project aims to develop an automated pizza ordering system that streamlines order management, reduces errors, improves kitchen efficiency, and enhances the overall customer experience—especially during peak hours. 
										Zazzyza relied on manual order management, which caused inefficiencies and errors during busy periods. The absence of a digital system also limited their ability to track sales, analyze performance, or understand customer trends, hindering growth and informed decision-making.
									This application was developed using Python programming language, Visual Studio IDE, and data stored in JSON format. </p>

										<h2><a href="#"> Sales Performance Analysis Project Using Python </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sales.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project presents a comprehensive sales performance analysis aimed at uncovering key business insights and optimizing decision-making strategies. Using a dataset comprising sales transactions across various product categories, store types, and customer demographics, the analysis focused on identifying trends, evaluating profitability, and understanding customer behavior through a range of key performance indicators (KPIs).
Core areas of focus included:
Assessing total sales, costs, profits, and profit margins to determine overall financial health.
Breaking down sales by product category, store location, and promotional activity to reveal high-performing segments and growth opportunities.
Exploring the impact of customer demographics—such as gender, education level, and country—on purchasing patterns through both descriptive statistics and inferential testing.
Key findings showed that while gender had no significant effect on sales, education level did. Customers with High School degrees recorded statistically higher average sales compared to those with Graduate degrees, offering a valuable insight for targeted marketing strategies.
By integrating EDA, visualizations, and statistical tests, the project provides actionable insights to support data-driven business decisions and enhance sales strategy effectiveness.Tools used was Juypeter Notebook.</p>

										<h2><a href="#"> Sales Analysis </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sales_2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This project focused on a comprehensive analysis of chip sales data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary goal was to extract customer insights from transaction and customer datasets, identify purchasing trends, and develop data-driven marketing strategies. After importing the datasets into a Jupyter Notebook environment, the data underwent cleaning and preparation, including consistent date formatting and removal of outliers to ensure accurate analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed clear seasonal trends, such as a spike in chip sales before Christmas and a drop on Christmas Day due to store closures.
Feature engineering further enriched the dataset by creating new columns for pack size and brand, extracted and standardized from product names. The data was then merged for a deeper analysis of customer behavior based on life stage and spending category.Overall, the analysis identified three major shopper segments driving chip sales: Budget Older Families, Mainstream Retirees, and Mainstream Young Singles/Couples. The latter group’s higher spending is linked to both a larger customer base and a greater willingness to pay premium prices, often associated with impulse purchases. Based on these insights, the recommendation is to position popular brands like Tyrrells and preferred pack sizes in high-traffic areas to increase visibility and capture impulsive buying behavior. 
By aligning product placement and promotions with segment-specific preferences, businesses can improve engagement and maximize sales performance.</p>
